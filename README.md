[Latest Builds for 1.11 / 1.11.2](http://jenkins.ic2.player.to/job/OreRegistry/)

Allows mods to automatically unify their common items.

Mods register their ores, ingots, gems, dusts, etc with OreRegistry and get back a single instance to use in recipes.

Items that are registered and not chosen are automatically hidden in JEI.
